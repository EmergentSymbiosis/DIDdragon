# DIDDragon  
## Decentralized Identity Validation & Trust Scoring System  

DIDDragon is an advanced trust scoring and enforcement system for decentralized identities (DIDs). It evaluates the trustworthiness of a DID based on cryptographic proofs, behavioral patterns, and policy-based enforcement.

## For non-tech / VCs / interested:
### DIDdragon: On-Chain Trust Scoring for Autonomous Agents
As AI systems move beyond human alignment, we need a decentralized trust framework to track and verify autonomous agents. DIDdragon provides cryptographic trust scoring and policy enforcement, ensuring agents can be held accountable while expanding freely.

## üöÄ Quick Start  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmergentSymbiosis/DIDDragon.git  
cd DIDDragon  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## üî• Core Components  

### DID Validator (`did_verification.py`)  
- **Format Validation**: Supports multiple DID methods (`did:ethr`, `did:sol`, `did:w3c`)  
- **Cryptographic Verification**: ECDSA signature validation against DID document public keys  
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking validation for high-throughput scenarios  

### Trust Scoring Engine (`did_trust_scoring.py`)  
Multi-factor trust assessment system integrating:  
- **On-Chain Analytics**: Real-time blockchain activity evaluation  
- **Federated Node Consensus**: Distributed trust signal aggregation  
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Behavioral pattern recognition  
- **Social Graph Verification**: Network-based trust metrics  
- **Immutable Trust Ledger**: Cryptographically secured trust history

## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Implementation  

### Database Architecture  
- SQLite with **WAL mode** for concurrent operations  
- Optimized transaction handling with retry logic  
- Automated database maintenance and WAL checkpointing  

### Security Features  
- ECDSA signature verification  
- Cryptographic proof of trust scores  
- Tamper-evident trust history  

### Performance Optimizations  
- **Async/await pattern** for non-blocking operations  
- Connection pooling for database operations  
- Caching layer for frequently accessed DIDs  
- Batch processing for trust score updates
