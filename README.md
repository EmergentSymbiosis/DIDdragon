# DIDDragon
## Decentralized Identity Validation & Trust Scoring System

A robust implementation of a DID (Decentralized Identifier) validation system with integrated trust scoring and policy enforcement mechanisms. Built for high-throughput identity verification in decentralized systems.

## Core Components

### DID Validator (`did_verification.py`)
- **Format Validation**: Supports multiple DID methods (`did:ethr`, `did:sol`, `did:w3c`)
- **Cryptographic Verification**: ECDSA signature validation against DID document public keys
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking validation for high-throughput scenarios

### Trust Scoring Engine (`did_trust_scoring.py`)
Multi-factor trust assessment system integrating:
- **On-Chain Analytics**: Real-time blockchain activity evaluation
- **Federated Node Consensus**: Distributed trust signal aggregation
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Behavioral pattern recognition
- **Social Graph Verification**: Network-based trust metrics
- **Immutable Trust Ledger**: Cryptographically secured trust history

### Trust Policy Enforcement (`did_trust_enforcement.py`)
- **Risk Detection**: Automated flagging of suspicious DIDs
- **Policy Engine**: Configurable trust thresholds and action triggers
- **Real-time Score Adjustment**: Dynamic trust recalculation based on behavior
- **Transaction Rate Limiting**: Adaptive throttling based on trust scores

### Recovery System (`did_trust_recovery.py`)
- **Automated Recovery Pipeline**: Configurable verification challenges
- **Trust Score Rehabilitation**: Gradual score restoration based on compliance
- **Historical Analysis**: Weight-based recovery influenced by past behavior
- **Challenge-Response Protocol**: Cryptographic proof of recovery steps

## Technical Implementation

### Database Architecture
- SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent operations
- Optimized transaction handling with retry logic
- Automated database maintenance and WAL checkpointing

### Security Features
- ECDSA signature verification
- Cryptographic proof of trust scores
- Tamper-evident trust history
- Rate limiting and DOS protection

### Performance Optimizations
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Caching layer for frequently accessed DIDs
- Batch processing for trust score updates

## Installation

Requires Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### DID Validation
```python
from did_verification import validate_did
result = await validate_did("did:ethr:0x123...")
```

### Trust Score Calculation
```python
from did_trust_scoring import get_trust_score
score = await get_trust_score("did:ethr:0x123...")
```

### Policy Enforcement
```python
from did_trust_enforcement import enforce_policy
result = await enforce_policy("did:ethr:0x123...", action="transfer")
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
```bash
TRUST_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.7
RECOVERY_CHALLENGE_COUNT=3
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=5
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=DIDDragon
```
